PyScaffold helps you setup a new Python project. Just install it with::

        pip install pyscaffold

or if you want to also install all *extensions* with::

        pip install pyscaffold[all]

If you prefer *conda* over *pip*, just install PyScaffold with::

    conda install -c conda-forge pyscaffold

This will give you a new ``putup`` command and you can just type::

    putup my_project

This will create a new folder called ``my_project`` containing a perfect *project
template* with everything you need for some serious coding. After the usual::

   python setup.py develop

you are all set and ready to go.

Type ``putup -h`` to learn about more configuration options. PyScaffold assumes
that you have Git_ installed and set up on your PC,
meaning at least your name and email are configured.
The project template in ``my_project`` provides you with following features:


Configuration & Packaging
=========================

All configuration can be done in ``setup.cfg`` like changing the description,
url, classifiers, installation requirements and so on as defined by setuptools_.
That means in most cases it is not necessary to tamper with ``setup.py``.

In order to build a source, binary or wheel distribution, just run
``python setup.py sdist``, ``python setup.py bdist`` or
``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` (recommended).

.. rubric:: Package and Files Data

Additional data, e.g. images and text files, that reside within your package and
are tracked by Git will automatically be included
(``include_package_data = True`` in ``setup.cfg``).
It is not necessary to have a ``MANIFEST.in`` file for this to work.

Versioning and Git Integration
==============================

Your project is an already initialised Git repository and ``setup.py`` uses
the information of tags to infer the version of your project with the help of
setuptools_scm_.
To use this feature, you need to tag with the format ``MAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH]``
, e.g. ``0.0.1`` or ``0.1``.
Run ``python setup.py --version`` to retrieve the current PEP440_-compliant
version. This version
will be used when building a package and is also accessible through
``my_project.__version__``.

Unleash the power of Git by using its `pre-commit hooks`_. This feature is
available through the ``--pre-commit`` flag. After your project's scaffold
was generated, make sure pre-commit is installed, e.g. ``pip install pre-commit``,
then just run ``pre-commit install``.

A default ``.gitignore`` file is also provided; it is
well adjusted for Python projects and the most common tools.


Sphinx Documentation
====================

PyScaffold will prepare a `docs` directory with all you need to start writing
your documentation.
Start editing the file ``docs/index.rst`` to extend the documentation.
The documentation also works with `Read the Docs`_.

The `Numpy and Google style docstrings`_ are activated by default.
Just make sure Sphinx 1.3 or above is installed.

If you have `make`_ and `Sphinx`_ installed in your computer, build the
documentation with ``make -C docs html`` and run doctests with
``make -C docs doctest``.
Alternatively, if your project was created with the ``--tox``
option, simply run ``tox -e doc`` ot ``tox -e doctest``.



Unittest & Coverage
===================

PyScaffold relies on `py.test`_ to run all unittests defined in the subfolder
``tests``.  Some sane default flags for py.test are already defined in the
``[pytest]`` section of ``setup.cfg``. The py.test plugin `pytest-cov`_ is used
to automatically generate a coverage report. It is also possible to provide
additional parameters and flags on the commandline, e.g., type::

    py.test -h

to show the help of py.test (requires `py.test`_ to be installed in your system
or virtualenv).

.. rubric:: JUnit and Coverage HTML/XML

For usage with a continuous integration software JUnit and Coverage XML output
can be activated in ``setup.cfg``. Use the flag ``--travis`` to generate
templates of the `Travis`_ configuration files
``.travis.yml`` and ``tests/travis_install.sh`` which even features the
coverage and stats system `Coveralls`_.
In order to use the virtualenv management and test tool `Tox`_ the flag
``--tox`` can be specified.


Management of Requirements & Licenses
=====================================

Installation requirements of your project can be defined inside ``setup.cfg``,
e.g. ``install_requires = numpy; scipy``. To avoid package dependency problems,
it is common to not pin installation requirements to any specific version,
although minimum versions, e.g. ``sphinx>=1.3``, or maximum versions, e.g.
``pandas<0.12``, are used sometimes.

More specific installation requirements should go into ``requirements.txt``.
This file can also be managed with the help of ``pip compile`` from `pip-tools`_
that basically pins packages to the current version, e.g. ``numpy==1.13.1``.
The packages defined in ``requirements.txt`` can be easily installed with::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

All licenses from `choosealicense.com`_ can be easily selected with the help
of the ``--license`` flag.


Extensions
==========

PyScaffold comes with several extensions:

* If you want a project setup for a *Data Science* task, just use ``--dsproject``
  after having installed `pyscaffoldext-dsproject`_.

* Create a `Django project`_ with the flag ``--django`` which is equivalent to
  ``django-admin startproject my_project`` enhanced by PyScaffold's features.

* Create a template for your own PyScaffold extension with ``--custom-extension``
  after having installed `pyscaffoldext-custom-extension`_ with ``pip``.

* Have a ``README.md`` based on MarkDown instead of ``README.rst`` by using
  ``--markdown`` after having installed `pyscaffoldext-markdown`_ with ``pip``.

* Add a ``pyproject.toml`` file according to `PEP 518`_ to your template by using
  ``--pyproject`` after having installed `pyscaffoldext-pyproject`_ with ``pip``.

* With the help of `Cookiecutter`_ it is possible to further customize your project
  setup with a template tailored for PyScaffold. Just use the flag ``--cookiecutter TEMPLATE``
  to use a cookiecutter template which will be refined by PyScaffold afterwards.

* ... and many more like ``--gitlab`` to create the necessary files for GitLab_.

Find more extensions within the `PyScaffold organisation`_ and consider contributing your own.
All extensions can easily be installed with ``pip pyscaffoldext-NAME``.

Easy Updating
=============

Keep your project's scaffold up-to-date by applying
``putup --update my_project`` when a new version of PyScaffold was released.
An update will only overwrite files that are not often altered by users like
``setup.py``. To update all files use ``--update --force``.
An existing project that was not setup with PyScaffold can be converted with
``putup --force existing_project``. The force option is completely safe to use
since the git repository of the existing project is not touched!
