PyScaffold helps you setup a new Python project. It is as easy as::

    putup my_project

This will create a new folder called ``my_project`` containing a perfect *project
template* with everything you need for some serious coding. After the usual::

   python setup.py develop

you are all set and ready to go which means in a Python shell you can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from my_project.skeleton import fib
   >>> fib(10)
   55

Type ``putup -h`` to learn about more configuration options. PyScaffold assumes
that you have `Git  <http://git-scm.com/>`_ installed and set up on your PC,
meaning at least your name and email are configured.
The project template in ``my_project`` provides you with a lot of
:ref:`features <features>`. PyScaffold is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python
3.4 and greater.


.. note::

   Currently PyScaffold 3.0 needs at least Python 3.4 due to a `bug in setuptools`_
   that only affects Python 2. For the time being use PyScaffold 2.5.* for Python 2.7
   instead.
