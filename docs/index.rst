PyScaffold helps you to easily setup a new Python project, it is as easy as::

    putup my_project

This will create a new folder ``my_project`` containing a perfect *project
template* with everything you need for some serious coding.

Type ``putup -h`` to learn about more configuration options. PyScaffold assumes
that you have `Git  <http://git-scm.com/>`_ installed and set up on your PC,
meaning at least your name and email configured.
The project template in ``my_project`` provides you with a lot of
:ref:`features <features>`. PyScaffold is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.4 and
3.5.
