PyScaffold helps you setup a new Python project. It is as easy as::

    putup my_project

This will create a new folder called ``my_project`` containing a perfect *project
template* [#index1]_ with everything you need for some serious coding. Checkout out
`this demo project`_, which was set up using Pyscaffold.

After the usual::

   pip install -U pip setuptools setuptools_scm
   pip install -e .

.. TODO: Remove the manual installation/update of pip, setuptools and setuptools_scm
   once pip starts supporting editable installs with pyproject.toml

you are all set and ready to go which means in a Python shell you can do the following:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from my_project.skeleton import fib
   >>> fib(10)
   55

Type ``putup -h`` to learn about more configuration options. PyScaffold assumes
that you have `Git`_ installed and set up on your PC, meaning at least your name
and email are configured.
The project template in ``my_project`` provides you with a lot of
:ref:`features <features>`.

There is also a `video tutorial`_
on how to develop a command-line application with the help of PyScaffold.

.. note::

   PyScaffold 4 is compatible with Python 3.6 and greater
   *(you might be able to run it on Python 3.5, however that is not
   officially supported)*.
   For legacy Python 2.7 please install PyScaffold 2.5
   *(not officially supported)*.

.. [#index1] PyScaffold's project template makes use of a dedicated ``src``
   folder to store all the package files meant for distribution (additional
   files like tests and documentation are kept in their own separated folders).
   You can find some comments and useful links about this design decision in
   our :ref:`FAQ <faq>`.
