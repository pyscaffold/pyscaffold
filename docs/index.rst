PyScaffold helps you setup a new Python project. It is as easy as::

    putup my_project

This will create a new folder called ``my_project`` containing a perfect *project
template* with everything you need for some serious coding. After the usual::

   python setup.py develop

you are all set and ready to go which means in a Python shell you can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from my_project.skeleton import fib
   >>> fib(10)
   55

Type ``putup -h`` to learn about more configuration options. PyScaffold assumes
that you have `Git`_ installed and set up on your PC, meaning at least your name
and email are configured.
The project template in ``my_project`` provides you with a lot of
:ref:`features <features>`.

There is also a `video tutorial`_
on how to develop a command-line application with the help of PyScaffold.


.. note::

   PyScaffold 4 is compatible with Python 3.6 and greater
   *(you might be able to run it on Python 3.5, however that is not
   officially supported)*.
   For legacy Python 2.7 please install PyScaffold 2.5
   *(not officially supported)*.
