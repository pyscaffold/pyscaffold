PyScaffold is the tool of choice for bootstrapping high quality Python
packages, ready to be shared on PyPI_ and installable via pip_.
It is easy to use and encourages the adoption of the best tools and
practices of the Python ecosystem, helping you and your team
to stay sane, happy and productive. The best part? It is stable and has been used
by thousands of developers for over half a decade!

.. _quickstart:

A single command is all you need to quickly start coding like a Python rockstar,
skipping all the difficult and tedious bits::

    putup my_project

This will create a new folder called ``my_project`` containing a
*perfect project template* with everything you need for getting things done.
Checkout out `this demo project`_, which was set up using Pyscaffold.

.. tip::
   .. versionadded:: 4.0
      We are trying out a brand new *interactive mode* that makes it
      even easier to use PyScaffold in its full potential.
      If you want to give it a shot, use the ``--interactive``, or simply ``-i`` option.

      The interactive command equivalent to the previous example is:
      ``putup -i my_project``.

You can ``cd`` into your new project and interact with it from the
command line after creating (or activating) an `isolated
development environment`_ (with virtualenv_, conda_ or your preferred tool),
and performing the usual editable_ install::

   pip install -e .

â€¦ all set and ready to go! Try the following in a Python shell:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from my_project.skeleton import fib
   >>> fib(10)
   55

Or if you are concerned about performing package maintainer tasks, make sure to
have tox_ installed and see what we have prepared for you out of the box::

   tox -e docs  # to build your documentation
   tox -e build  # to build your package distribution
   tox -e publish  # to test your project uploads correctly in test.pypi.org
   tox -e publish -- --repository pypi  # to release your package to PyPI
   tox -av  # to list all the tasks available

Type ``putup -h`` to learn about :ref:`other things PyScaffold can do <features>` for your project,
and if you are not convinced yet, have a look on these :ref:`reasons to use PyScaffold <reasons>`.

There is also a `video tutorial`_ on how to develop a command-line application with the help of PyScaffold.


.. note::
   This document refers to the latest version of PyScaffold (v4).
   Please refer to `v3.3`_ for the previous stable version.
   Both versions are compatible with Python 3.6 and greater.

   For legacy Python 2.7 please install PyScaffold 2.5
   *(not officially supported)*.

Notes
-----

#. PyScaffold's project template makes use of a dedicated ``src``
   folder to store all the package files meant for distribution (additional
   files like tests and documentation are kept in their own separated folders).
   You can find some comments and useful links about this design decision in
   our :ref:`FAQ <faq>`.

#. The ``pip install -e .`` command installs your project in editable_ mode,
   making it available in import statements as any other Python module.
   It might fail if your have an old version of Python's package manager and
   tooling in your current environment. Please make sure you are using the
   intended environment (either a `virtual environment`_ [*recommended*] or the
   default installation of Python in the operating system) and try to update
   them with ``python -m pip install -U pip setuptools``.

#. If you are using a `virtual environment`_, please remember to
   re-activate it everytime you close your shell, otherwise you will not be
   able to import your project in the REPL_. To check if you have already
   activated it you can run ``which python`` on Linux and OSX, ``where python``
   on the classical Windows command prompt, or ``Get-Command python`` on
   PowerShell.
