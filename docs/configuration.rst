Package Configuration
=====================

Projects set up with PyScaffold rely on `setuptools`_, and therefore can be
easily configured/customised via ``setup.cfg``. Check out the example below:

.. literalinclude:: ./example_setup.cfg
    :language: ini

You might also want to have a look on `pyproject.toml`_ for specifying
dependencies required during the build:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/pyscaffold/templates/pyproject_toml.template
    :language: toml

Please note PyScaffold will add some internal information to ``setup.cfg``,
we do that to make updates a little smarter.

.. note::
   To avoid splitting the configuration and build parameters among several
   files, PyScaffold uses the same file as `setuptools`_ (``setup.cfg``).
   Storing configuration in `pyproject.toml`_ is not supported.
   In the future, if the default build metadata location changes (as proposed
   by `PEP 621`_), PyScaffold will follow the same pattern.


.. _default-cfg:

PyScaffold's Own Configuration
==============================

PyScaffold also allows you to save your favourite configuration to a file that
will be automatically read every time you run ``putup``, this way you can avoid
always retyping the same command line options.

The locations of the configuration files vary slightly across platforms, but in
general the following rule applies:

- Linux: ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pyscaffold/default.cfg`` with fallback to ``~/.config/pyscaffold/default.cfg``
- OSX: ``~/Library/Preferences/pyscaffold/default.cfg``
- Windows(â‰¥7): ``%APPDATA%\pyscaffold\pyscaffold\default.cfg``

The file format resembles the ``setup.cfg`` generated automatically by
PyScaffold, but with only the ``metadata`` and ``pyscaffold`` sections, for
example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [metadata]
    author = John Doe
    author-email = john.joe@gmail.com
    license = MPL-2.0

    [pyscaffold]
    extensions =
        travis
        pre-commit

With this file in place, typing only::

    $ putup myproj

will have the same effect as if you had typed::

    $ putup --license MPL-2.0 --travis --pre-commit myproj

.. note::

    For the time being, only the following options are allowed in the config file:

    - **metadata** section: ``author``, ``author-email`` and ``license``
    - **pyscaffold** section: ``extensions`` (and associated opts)

    Options associated with extensions are the ones prefixed by an extension name.


To prevent PyScaffold from reading an existing config file, you can pass the
``--no-config`` option in the CLI. You can also save the given options when
creating a new project with the ``--save-config`` option. Finally, to read the
configurations from a location other then the default, use the ``--config PATH``
option. See ``putup --help`` for more details.

.. warning::

    *Experimental Feature* - We are still evaluating how this new and exciting
    feature will work, so its API (including file format) is not considered
    stable and might change between minor versions. As previously stated, if
    the configuration file for `setuptools`_ changes (e.g. with `PEP 621`_),
    PyScaffold will likely follow and change the format for its own configuration.
