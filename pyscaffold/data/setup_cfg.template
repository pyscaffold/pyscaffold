# Add here data to be included which lies OUTSIDE your package, e.g.

# This is the same as adding files to MANIFEST.in which is not needed anymore.
# The destination is relative to the root of your virtual environment.
# Use ** as wildcard if you want to recursively include a pattern, e.g.
# tests/**.py would include all py-files in all subfolders of tests.

# Options for py.test:
# Specify command line options as you would do when invoking py.test directly.
# e.g. --cov-report html (or xml) for html/xml output or --junitxml junit.xml
# in order to write a coverage file that can be read by Jenkins.
